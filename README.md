# task-manager

Implement a RESTful API in Node.js (Express) that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks. Each task should have a title, description, status (pending/completed), and a due date.

Requirements:
* Use `Express.js` for the backend.
* Store data in `MongoDB` (using `Mongoose`).
* Implement error handling and validation.
* Use async/await for database operations.
* Implement pagination when fetching tasks.
* Write a middleware to log incoming requests.
